Data = eqn_readSmosDBL(filename)

The function reads an Ocean Salinity User Data Product (OSUDP) data block file (.DBL) from the SMOS mission. It takes as input the filename and gives as output a matlab matrix of doubles with as many rows as there are records in the file and as many columns as there are variables. To understand what each column means, you have to check the documentation file "eqn_readSmosDBL_Var_Table.pdf" which explains the variables contained in the data file. The column number of a particular variable corresponds to its Field ID number minus one. For example, the Latitude variable has a Field # 03, therefore it will be found in the second column of the resulting matrix. The only is exception to this rule is the first variable (with Field # equal to 01), which is just the number of records in the file and can be derived by measuring the number of rows in the resulting data matrix e.g. by calling size(Data, 1).
